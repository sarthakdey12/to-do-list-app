# to-do-list-app
A simple command-line Python application to manage your daily tasks. This app allows you to:

- View the list of tasks.
- Add new tasks to the list.
- Remove completed tasks.
- Save tasks to a file so they persist between sessions.
This project helps you practice file handling, user input, and basic Python concepts such as loops, functions, and conditionals.

Features
- View Tasks: Displays a list of all your current tasks.
- Add Tasks: Allows you to add new tasks to the list.
- Remove Tasks: You can delete tasks by their number in the list.
- Persistent Data: Tasks are saved to a file (tasks.txt), so they remain even after closing the app.

Requirements
- Python 3.x

Usage
- Clone or download the repository.
- Run the todo_list.py script.
- Follow the on-screen prompts to manage your tasks.
